				<h3>What do you currently do?</h3>
				<p>I am a teaching assistant for Mrs. Phinney's ISTM 210 class for this fall 2017. I also assisted
				in the ISTM 210 class that happened over the summer, as well as a class dedicated to C# programming
				and a retired Business Communications class. I also work part-time at H-E-B as a Business Center 
				Representative. Most importantly, I am still a student, and I am focused on graduating this December.</p>
				<h3>Did you do anything else this summer?</h3>
				<p>Before I began TA'ing this summer, I went on the Ireland Study Abroad with Dr. Manley and a
				handful of other students from the INFO department. We spent five days in Dublin, getting to know the city
				and understanding why so many businesses choose Ireland as a place of headquarters. We also visited a start-up
				company that explained some of Ireland's corporate laws as well as the push from the government assisting in
				start-up companies.

				<h3>Are you done with the website?</h3>
				<p>I am not! I am continuously improving my code and practicing techniques I am learning
				in my Web Applications class to create a great website. When you visit again, 
				there might be changes around the site!</p>
				<h3>Can this be used for my ISTM 210 project?</h3>
				<p>Yes and No! There are elements here you can use that will allow you
				to understand how a website can be formatted, but ultimately, your website will not end up
				looking like this. If you have any questions, please don't hesistate to visit me and the other TA's
				in the computer lab!</p>
